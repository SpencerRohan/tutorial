# Front-End Track

#### Phase 1
This section went by pretty well. I had to remind myself some Bootstrap fundementals. I had a little bit of a hiccup when it came to the bottom columns. I had only used flex once before(I think), and I had never used it with Bootstrap - so it was a learning moment for sure.

I played with the idea of pushing the columns when it came to the mobile version. My thought process on that was the client probably would want their header before the coupon.

##### Questions and Topics:

+ PHP uses and general practices. -- 12/2 Scott went over a lot of this
+ MAMP implementations, outside of server/database uses.
+ When using bootstrap, is it common to use flex? Should I implement at the beginning stages? Any way of doing this easily without flex(specifically with Bootstrap).
+ Getting started with Bootstrap, would be curious to see where others begin a project.

Would love any notes, feedback, and guidence on html & css practices. Anything look super hacky or amateur hour?

Confident in coding scale 1-10, Phase 1 was about an 8 or 9. I got stuck messing with margins and a few super minor bugs, but nothing I felt overwhelmed by.
